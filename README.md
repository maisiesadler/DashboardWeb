# Dashboard

Personal dashboard with push notifications.

## Service worker

For the service worker to work, public/private keys must be provided.

The service expects two environment variables to be set, `DASHBOARD_KEYS_PUBLIC` and `DASHBOARD_KEYS_PRIVATE`.

Keys can be generated here: https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me.
